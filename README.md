Breast cancer, if detected early, has the potential to save the lives of thousands of women. We will be able to classify and predict whether a cancer is malignant or not by using machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to medical research. It improves the system, reduces human errors, and reduces manual errors.This project assists real-life patients and doctors in gathering as much information as possible. The primary goal of the examination is to improve the accuracy of the breast cancer diagnosis by further developing breast malignant growth predictions. It is hoped that it will help people get cancer treatment earlier and work on their lives.
